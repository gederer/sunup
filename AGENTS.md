# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Sunup is a Next.js 16 app with Convex integration. UI routes, layouts, and client components live in `app/`, with `app/convex-client-provider.tsx` responsible for wiring the Convex client into the component tree. Global styles and Tailwind theme tokens sit in `app/globals.css`. Autogenerated assets and static files belong in `public/`. Serverless data logic should expand the Convex schema in `convex/schema.ts` and store queries or mutations alongside it; the `convex/_generated/` directory is managed by the Convex CLI and must not be edited manually. Linting defaults live in `eslint.config.mjs` and apply repository-wide.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev` — start the Next.js dev server on http://localhost:3000 with hot reload.
- `npm run build` — create an optimized production bundle for deployment.
- `npm run start` — serve the production build locally (requires a prior `npm run build`).
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint with Next.js core web vitals rules to catch accessibility and performance regressions early.
- `npx convex dev` — optional; run a local Convex deployment when developing features that depend on Convex functions.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Write components and files in TypeScript using 2-space indentation. Component files should be PascalCase (`WeatherCard.tsx`), hooks and helpers camelCase (`useSunrise.ts`). Co-locate UI logic with its route inside `app/` and prefer server components unless client interactivity is required. Tailwind utility classes are allowed directly in JSX; favor descriptive class compositions over custom CSS.

## Testing Guidelines
Automated tests are not yet configured, so add new tests alongside features—React component tests in `app/__tests__/` using Testing Library, Convex logic tests in `convex/` with mocked contexts. Keep test names descriptive (`renders sunrise chart when data present`). Include smoke tests for new routes before opening a PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Current history only contains the Create Next App bootstrap commit; adopt Conventional Commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) to convey intent going forward. Every PR should summarize scope, note any schema or environment changes, reference related issues, and attach screenshots or screen recordings when UI changes are visible. Ensure `npm run lint` (and any added tests) pass before requesting review.

## Configuration & Environment
Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in your `.env.local` before running the app; without it the Convex provider will throw at startup. Do not commit `.env*` files. When adding new environment variables, document them in the PR description and update onboarding docs as needed.
